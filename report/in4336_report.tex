\section{Introduction}

Solvers for NP-Hard problems can be used to solve instances of other NP-Hard problems by polynomially transforming the other problem instance. This is called an encoding.
This possibility makes it feasible to make highly-optimized solving algorithms called solvers for certain relatively general NP-Hard problems.

For most popular problems multiple solvers exists, and benchmarks are available or contests are held to compare them.
However comparisons between problems are rarer and in this project we will do such a comparison.
We want to see if some problems are more suitable to encode other problems in or if the choise of problem to encode to makes little impact.

Another question is whether translations into intermediary problems add significant overhead.
While we know that polynomial transformations do not increase the complexity of a NP-Hard problem, it might still have a practical impact in how fast a problem instance can be solved or what the largest solvable problem instance is.
With this we want to see if encodings can be viably done in smaller easier steps, or if it is better to encode the problem directly into the target problem.

We formulated the following research question for this project:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[RQ1]{Is there a speed difference between formalisms when solving an identical problem instance?}
\item[RQ2]{Are intermediate transformations viable?}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item[RQ2.1]{Does an intermediate transformation significantly decrease the speed with which problem instances can be solved?}
	\item[RQ2.2]{Does an intermediate transformation decrease the size of the largest possible problem instances which can be solved?}
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

In answering our research questions we will focus on solvers for \emph{Integer Linear Programming}, \emph{Satisfiability} (SAT) and \emph{Satisfiability Modulo Theories} (SMT).

As problems to encode we took \emph{Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem} (RCPSP) and \emph{Graph Coloring} (GC).
