<i> This paper outlines a suggested graph format.  If you
have comments on this or other formats or you have information you
think should be included, please send a note to <tt>

</p><h2>Introduction</h2>
One purpose of the DIMACS Challenge is to ease the effort required to
test and compare algorithms and heuristics by providing a common
testbed of instances and analysis tools.  To facilitate this effort, a
standard format must be chosen for the problems addressed.  This
document outlines a format for graphs that is suitable for those
looking at graph coloring and finding cliques in graphs.  This format
is a flexible format suitable for many types of graph and network
problems.  This format was also the format chosen for the First
Computational Challenge on network flows and matchings.<p>
This document describes three problems:  unweighted clique, weighted
clique, and graph coloring.  A separate format is used for
satisfiability.</p><p>
</p><h2>File Formats for Graph Problems</h2> <p>
This section describes a standard file format for graph inputs and outputs. 
There is no  requirement that participants follow these specifications;
however, compatible implementations will be able to make full use of 
DIMACS support tools.  (Some tools assume that output is appended
to input in a single file.) </p><p>
Participants are welcome to develop translation programs to convert
instances to and from more convenient, or more compact, representations;
the Unix <b> awk</b> facility is recommended as especially suitable
for this task.   </p><p>
All files contain ASCII characters.  Input and output files contain
several types of <i> lines</i>, described below.  A line is terminated
with an end-of-line character.  Fields in each line are separated by
at least one blank space.  Each line begins with a one-character
designator to identify the line type.</p><p>
</p><h3>Input Files</h3> <p>
An input file contains all the information about a graph needed to
define either a clique problem or a coloring problem.  Some
information may be included that is not relevant to one problem (for
instance, node weights are not needed for coloring problem) so that
information may be ignored.</p><p>
In this format, nodes are numbered from 1 up to <i>n</i>.  There are <i>m</i>
edges in the graph.</p><p>
Files are assumed to be well-formed and internally consistent: node
identifier values are valid, nodes are defined uniquely, exactly <i>m</i>
edges are defined, and so forth.  A input checker will be made
available to ensure compatibility with this standard.</p><p>
</p><p></p><ul><p>
</p><li> <b> Comments.</b> Comment lines give human-readable 
information about the file and are ignored by programs.  Comment lines
can appear anywhere in the file.  Each comment line begins with a
lower-case character <b> c</b>.
<pre> 
c This is an example of a comment line.
</pre> <p>
</p></li><li> <b> Problem line.</b>  There is one problem line per input file.  The 
problem line must appear before any node or arc descriptor lines.  For
network instances, the problem line has the following format.
<pre>p FORMAT NODES EDGES
</pre> 
The lower-case character <tt> p</tt> signifies that this is the problem
line.  The <tt> FORMAT</tt> field is for consistency with the previous
Challenge, and should contain the word “edge”.
The <tt> NODES</tt> field contains an integer value
specifying <i>n</i>, the number of nodes in the graph.  The <tt> EDGES</tt>
field contains an integer value specifying <i>m</i>, the number of edges in
the graph.<p>
</p></li><li> <b> Node Descriptors.</b>   
For this Challenge, a node descriptor is required only for the
weighted clique problem.  These lines will give the weight assigned to
a node in the clique.  There is one node descriptor line for each
node, with the following format.  Nodes without a descriptor will take
on a default value of 1.<p>
</p><pre>n ID VALUE
</pre><p>
The lower-case character <tt> n</tt> signifies that this is a node
descriptor line.  The <tt> ID</tt> field gives a node identification
number, an integer between 1 and <i>n</i>.  The <tt> VALUE</tt> gives the
objective value for having this node in the clique.  This value is
assumed to be integer and can be either positive or negative (or zero).</p><p>
</p></li><li> <b> Edge Descriptors.</b> There is one edge descriptor
line for each edge the graph, each with the following format.  Each 
edge <i>(v,w)</i> appears exactly once in the
input file and is not repeated as <i>(w,v)</i>. <p>
</p><pre>e W  V 
</pre> 
The lower-case character <tt> e</tt> signifies that this is an 
edge descriptor line.  For an edge <i>(w,v)</i> the fields <tt> W</tt>  and 
<tt> V</tt> specify its endpoints.  <p>
</p></li><li> <b> Optional Descriptors.</b>  In addition to the required
information, there can be additional pieces of information about a
graph.  This will typically define the parameters used to generate the
graph or otherwise define generator--specific information.  The
following list may be added to as interesting problem generators are
decided on:<p>
</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Geometric Descriptors.  One common method to generate or display
graphs is to have the nodes be embedded in some space and to have the
edges be included according to some function of the distance between
nodes according to some metric.  The node information can be defined
by a dimension descriptor and a vertex embedding descriptor.<p>
</p><pre>d DIM METRIC
</pre><p>
 is the dimension descriptor.  DIM is an integer giving the
number of dimensions of the space, while METRIC is a string
representing the metric for the space.  METRIC is a string that can
take a number of forms.  L<i>p</i> (i.e. L1, L2, L122, and so on) denotes
the <i>ℓ<sub>p</sub></i> norm where the distance between two nodes embedded at
<i>(x<sub>1</sub>,x<sub>2</sub>,…,x<sub>d</sub>)</i> and <i>(y<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>,… y<sub>d</sub>)</i> is <i>(∑<sub>i=1</sub><sup>d</sup>
|x<sub>i</sub>-y<sub>i</sub>|<sup>p</sup>)<sup>1/p</sup></i>.  The string LINF is used to denote the
<i>ℓ<sub>∞</sub></i> norm.  L2S denotes the squared euclidean norm (which can
be less susceptible to computer--differences in round--off and
accuracy issues).</p><p>
</p><pre>v  X1  X2  X3  . .. XD
</pre> 
The lower-case character <tt> v</tt> signifies that this is a vertex
embedding descriptor line.  The fields <tt> X1, X2 . . .XD</tt> give the
<i>d</i> coordinate values for the vertex.  Note that these lines must
appear after the <tt> d</tt> descriptor.<p>
</p></li><li>Parameter Descriptors.  The parameter descriptors are used to
give other information about how the graph was generated.  The lines
are generator--specific, and as such it is not expected that most
codes will use most (or any) of them.  They are included only to aid
those codes specifically designed to attack specially structured
problems.  The general form of the parameter descriptor is:<p>
</p><pre>x PARAM VALUE
</pre> 
The lower-case character <tt> x</tt> signifies that this is a parameter
descriptor line.  The PARAM field is a string that gives the name of
the parameter, while the VALUE field is a numeric value that gives the
corresponding value.  The following PARAM values have been defined:<p>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
PARAM</td><td>Description
</td></tr><tr><td>
MINLENGTH</td><td>(Geometric Graphs) Edge included only if 
</td></tr><tr><td>
</td><td>length greater than or equal to VALUE
</td></tr><tr><td>
MAXLENGTH</td><td>(Geometric Graphs) Edge included only if 
</td></tr><tr><td>
</td><td>length less than or equal to VALUE
</td></tr><tr><td>
</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>
Note that this information is in addition to the required edge
descriptors.</p><p>
</p></li></ul><p></p>
</li></ul><p></p><p>
</p><h3>Output Files</h3>
Every algorithm or heuristic should create an output file.  This
output file should consist of one or more of the following lines,
depending on the type of algorithm and problem being solved.<p>
</p><p></p><ul><p>
</p><li> <b> Solution Line</b><p>
</p><pre>s TYPE SOLUTION
</pre>
The lower--case character <tt> s</tt> signifies that this is a solution 
line. The <tt> TYPE</tt> field denotes the type of solution contained in
the file.  This should be one of the following strings: “col”
denotes a graph coloring, “clq” denotes a maximum weighted clique,
and “cqu” denotes a maximum unweighted clique (one that has ignored
the <tt> n</tt> descriptor lines).<p>
The <tt> SOLUTION</tt> field contains an integer corresponding
to the solution value.  This is the clique size for unweighted clique,
clique value for weighted clique, or number of colors used for graph
coloring.</p><p>

<pre>b BOUND
</pre><p>
The lower--case character <tt> b</tt> signifies that this is a bound on
the the solution.  The <tt> BOUND</tt> field contains an integer value
that gives a bound on the solution value.  This bound is an upper
bound on the maximum clique value for cliques and weighted clique and
a lower bound on the number of colors needed for coloring the graph.</p><p>

\section{Introduction}
One purpose of the DIMACS Challenge is to ease the effort required to
test and compare algorithms and heuristics by providing a common
testbed of instances and analysis tools.  To facilitate this effort, a
standard format must be chosen for the problems addressed.  This
document outlines a format for graphs that is suitable for those
looking at graph coloring and finding cliques in graphs.  This format
is a flexible format suitable for many types of graph and network
problems.  This format was also the format chosen for the First
Computational Challenge on network flows and matchings.

This document describes three problems:  unweighted clique, weighted
clique, and graph coloring.  A separate format is used for
satisfiability.


\section{File Formats for Graph Problems} 

This section describes a standard file format for graph inputs and outputs. 
There is no  requirement that participants follow these specifications;
however, compatible implementations will be able to make full use of 
DIMACS support tools.  (Some tools assume that output is appended
to input in a single file.) 

Participants are welcome to develop translation programs to convert
instances to and from more convenient, or more compact, representations;
the Unix {\bf awk} facility is recommended as especially suitable
for this task.   

All files contain ASCII characters.  Input and output files contain
several types of {\em lines}, described below.  A line is terminated
with an end-of-line character.  Fields in each line are separated by
at least one blank space.  Each line begins with a one-character
designator to identify the line type.

\subsection{Input Files} 

An input file contains all the information about a graph needed to
define either a clique problem or a coloring problem.  Some
information may be included that is not relevant to one problem (for
instance, node weights are not needed for coloring problem) so that
information may be ignored.

In this format, nodes are numbered from 1 up to $n$.  There are $m$
edges in the graph.

Files are assumed to be well-formed and internally consistent: node
identifier values are valid, nodes are defined uniquely, exactly $m$
edges are defined, and so forth.  A input checker will be made
available to ensure compatibility with this standard.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Comments.} Comment lines give human-readable 
information about the file and are ignored by programs.  Comment lines
can appear anywhere in the file.  Each comment line begins with a
lower-case character {\bf c}.
\begin{verbatim} 
c This is an example of a comment line.
\end{verbatim} 

\item {\bf Problem line.}  There is one problem line per input file.  The 
problem line must appear before any node or arc descriptor lines.  For
network instances, the problem line has the following format.
\begin{verbatim}
p FORMAT NODES EDGES
\end{verbatim} 
The lower-case character {\tt p} signifies that this is the problem
line.  The {\tt FORMAT} field is for consistency with the previous
Challenge, and should contain the word ``edge''.
The {\tt NODES} field contains an integer value
specifying $n$, the number of nodes in the graph.  The {\tt EDGES}
field contains an integer value specifying $m$, the number of edges in
the graph.

\item {\bf Node Descriptors.}   
For this Challenge, a node descriptor is required only for the
weighted clique problem.  These lines will give the weight assigned to
a node in the clique.  There is one node descriptor line for each
node, with the following format.  Nodes without a descriptor will take
on a default value of 1.

\begin{verbatim}
n ID VALUE
\end{verbatim}

The lower-case character {\tt n} signifies that this is a node
descriptor line.  The {\tt ID} field gives a node identification
number, an integer between 1 and $n$.  The {\tt VALUE} gives the
objective value for having this node in the clique.  This value is
assumed to be integer and can be either positive or negative (or zero).


\item {\bf Edge Descriptors.} There is one edge descriptor
line for each edge the graph, each with the following format.  Each 
edge $(v,w)$ appears exactly once in the
input file and is not repeated as $(w,v)$. 

\begin{verbatim}
e W  V 
\end{verbatim} 
The lower-case character {\tt e} signifies that this is an 
edge descriptor line.  For an edge $(w,v)$ the fields {\tt W}  and 
{\tt V} specify its endpoints.  

\item {\bf Optional Descriptors.}  In addition to the required
information, there can be additional pieces of information about a
graph.  This will typically define the parameters used to generate the
graph or otherwise define generator--specific information.  The
following list may be added to as interesting problem generators are
decided on:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Geometric Descriptors.}  One common method to generate or display
graphs is to have the nodes be embedded in some space and to have the
edges be included according to some function of the distance between
nodes according to some metric.  The node information can be defined
by a dimension descriptor and a vertex embedding descriptor.

\begin{verbatim}
d DIM METRIC
\end{verbatim}

\noindent is the dimension descriptor.  DIM is an integer giving the
number of dimensions of the space, while METRIC is a string
representing the metric for the space.  METRIC is a string that can
take a number of forms.  L$p$ (i.e. L1, L2, L122, and so on) denotes
the $\ell_p$ norm where the distance between two nodes embedded at
$(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_d)$ and $(y_1,y_2,\ldots y_d)$ is $(\sum_{i=1}^d
|x_i-y_i|^p)^{1/p}$.  The string LINF is used to denote the
$\ell_\infty$ norm.  L2S denotes the squared euclidean norm (which can
be less susceptible to computer--differences in round--off and
accuracy issues).

\begin{verbatim}
v  X1  X2  X3  . .. XD
\end{verbatim} 
The lower-case character {\tt v} signifies that this is a vertex
embedding descriptor line.  The fields {\tt X1, X2 . . .XD} give the
$d$ coordinate values for the vertex.  Note that these lines must
appear after the {\tt d} descriptor.

\item{Parameter Descriptors.}  The parameter descriptors are used to
give other information about how the graph was generated.  The lines
are generator--specific, and as such it is not expected that most
codes will use most (or any) of them.  They are included only to aid
those codes specifically designed to attack specially structured
problems.  The general form of the parameter descriptor is:

\begin{verbatim}
x PARAM VALUE
\end{verbatim} 
The lower-case character {\tt x} signifies that this is a parameter
descriptor line.  The PARAM field is a string that gives the name of
the parameter, while the VALUE field is a numeric value that gives the
corresponding value.  The following PARAM values have been defined:

\begin{tabular}{ll}\hline
PARAM&amp;Description\\\hline
MINLENGTH&amp;(Geometric Graphs) Edge included only if \\
&amp;length greater than or equal to VALUE\\
MAXLENGTH&amp;(Geometric Graphs) Edge included only if \\
&amp;length less than or equal to VALUE\\\hline
\end{tabular}

Note that this information is in addition to the required edge
descriptors.

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Output Files}
Every algorithm or heuristic should create an output file.  This
output file should consist of one or more of the following lines,
depending on the type of algorithm and problem being solved.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Solution Line}

\begin{verbatim}
s TYPE SOLUTION
\end{verbatim}
The lower--case character {\tt s} signifies that this is a solution 
line. The {\tt TYPE} field denotes the type of solution contained in
the file.  This should be one of the following strings: ``col''
denotes a graph coloring, ``clq'' denotes a maximum weighted clique,
and ``cqu'' denotes a maximum unweighted clique (one that has ignored
the {\tt n} descriptor lines).

The {\tt SOLUTION} field contains an integer corresponding
to the solution value.  This is the clique size for unweighted clique,
clique value for weighted clique, or number of colors used for graph
coloring.

\item {\bf Bound Line}
\begin{verbatim}
b BOUND
\end{verbatim}

The lower--case character {\tt b} signifies that this is a bound on
the the solution.  The {\tt BOUND} field contains an integer value
that gives a bound on the solution value.  This bound is an upper
bound on the maximum clique value for cliques and weighted clique and
a lower bound on the number of colors needed for coloring the graph.

\item{\bf Clique Line}
\begin{verbatim}
v V
\end{verbatim}

The lower-case character {\tt v} signifies that this is a clique vertex
line.  The {\tt V} field gives the node number for the node in the
clique.  There will be one clique line for each node in the clique.

\item{\bf Label Line}
\begin{verbatim}
l V N
\end{verbatim}

The lower-case character {\tt l} signifies that this is a label 
line, generally used for graph coloring.  The {\tt V} field gives the node number for the node in the
clique while the {\tt N} field gives the corresponding label.  There will be one label line for each node in the graph.
